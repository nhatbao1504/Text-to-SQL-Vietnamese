# STUDY ON TECHNIQUES FOR CONVERTING NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERIES TO SQL COMMAND WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
Data is one of the most valuable resources today, but querying it with **SQL** is often a barrier for non-technical users.   This project studies and develops a **Vietnamese Text-to-SQL system** powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as **Qwen2.5, Llama3.2, and Ministral-3B**.  
This project focuses on building a **Vietnamese Text-to-SQL system** powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as **Qwen2.5, Llama3.2, and Ministral-3B**.  

The goal is to enable users to ask questions in **natural Vietnamese language** and automatically generate corresponding **SQL queries** that can be executed on relational databases.  

By leveraging **fine-tuning techniques** (SFT, LoRA/QLoRA), **prompt engineering**, and **Unsloth optimization**, the system achieves efficient training and high execution accuracy.

## üöÄ Key Features
- Convert Vietnamese natural language questions into SQL queries.  
- Support multiple database schemas.  
- Fine-tuned with advanced techniques:
  - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
  - **LoRA / QLoRA** (parameter-efficient fine-tuning)
  - **Prompt Engineering** (Alpaca-style prompts)
  - **Unsloth** (training optimization for speed & memory).  
- Evaluated using **Execution Accuracy (EA)** and **Exact Match Accuracy (EM)**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database
We use two widely recognized **Text-to-SQL benchmark datasets**:  

- [**WikiSQL**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00103) (Zhong et al., 2017): Contains simple queries with basic `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses.  
- [**Spider**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08887) (Yu et al., 2018): A large-scale dataset with **complex queries**, requiring `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and nested subqueries.

### üîÑ Translation into Vietnamese
Since both datasets are originally in English, we translated **natural language questions** and **database schemas** into Vietnamese.  

#### Example (WikiSQL):
- **Original question (EN):**  
  `What is the population of California?`  

- **Translated question (VN):**  
  `D√¢n s·ªë c·ªßa California l√† bao nhi√™u?`  

- **Original schema (EN):**  
  `states(id, name, population)`  

- **Translated schema (VN):**  
  `bang(id, ten, dan_so)`  

- **Generated SQL:**  
  ```sql
  SELECT dan_so 
  FROM bang 
  WHERE ten = 'California';
  ```

#### Example (Spider):
- **Original question (EN):**  
  `List the names of students who enrolled in 2020.`  

- **Translated question (VN):**  
  `Li·ªát k√™ t√™n sinh vi√™n ƒë√£ ghi danh v√†o nƒÉm 2020.`  

- **Schema (VN):**  
  ```
  sinh_vien(id, ten, nam_ghi_danh)
  ```  

- **Generated SQL:**  
  ```sql
  SELECT ten 
  FROM sinh_vien 
  WHERE nam_ghi_danh = 2020;
  ```

## üìä Experimental Results
| Model           | Dataset (VN) | EM (%) | EA (%) |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Qwen2.5-3B      | Spider       | 78.5   | 82.1   |
| Llama3.2-3B     | Spider       | 75.2   | 79.3   |
| Ministral-3B    | Spider       | 73.6   | 80.4   |

## üìê Evaluation Metrics
- **Exact Match (EM):** Measures whether the predicted SQL query exactly matches the gold (reference) query.  
- **Execution Accuracy (EA):** Measures whether the predicted query, when executed on the database, returns the same result as the gold query.  

These two metrics complement each other: EM is stricter (requires identical syntax), while EA allows flexibility as long as the results are correct.
